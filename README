This is a small set of scripts to make it relatively easy to manage a
stable of kvm instances in a fairly secure and isolated fashion.

The basic model is to use runit to supervise each KVM instance, with a
single, non-privileged user account for each instance.

A typical workflow to start an installer is:

kvm-creator create $GUESTNAME [$DISKSIZE [$RAM [$TAP [$MAC] ] ] ]
# set up boot media for the host ("put the installer CD in the drive"):
ln -s /usr/local/share/ISOs/d-i.iso /home/$GUESTNAME/vms/$GUESTNAME/cd.iso
# set up access to the account:
mkdir -p /home/$GUESTNAME/.ssh
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys >> /home/$GUESTNAME/.ssh/authorized_keys
# start up the host
update-service --add /etc/sv/kvm/$GUESTNAME


To access the guest's serial console, do:

   ssh -t $GUESTNAME@host.machine screen -x $GUESTNAME


trouble getting a serial console-enabled debian
installer ISO?  try using the di-maker script.

All patches, fixes, suggestions welcome!
