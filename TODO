TODO for KVM-Manager
--------------------

(much) better documentation

file re-organization/restructuring

debian packaging?

more flexibility with networking (currently only supports
   tun/tap-style bridging)

/usr/local/sbin is hard-coded in places (e.g. in the run and finish
   scripts); it probably shouldn't be.

screen logging is still sub-par, and could potentially fill the host
   disks if the kernel spew is immense -- rotate?  filter through
   svlogd somehow?  same problem as cereal.
